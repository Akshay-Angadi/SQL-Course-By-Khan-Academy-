## SQL Practice Queries Repository
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I've been working on as part of my learning journey. I started learning SQL through Khan Academy and wanted to share my progress and practice with others who might find it helpful.

### Contents
In this repository, you'll find:
1. Practice Queries: A series of SQL queries that I've written while learning SQL on Khan Academy. These queries cover various topics and concepts, starting from basic SELECT statements to more advanced JOINs, subqueries, and aggregations.
2. Topics: Each query file is organized into folders based on the topic it covers. This makes it easier to navigate and learn specific concepts.
